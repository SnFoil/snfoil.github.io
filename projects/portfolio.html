I'm excited to share the process of how I built this site and the technologies I used to bring it to life.</p> <h3>Concept and Design</h3> <p>The idea behind this site was to create a clean, more minimalist design that showcases my work and skills effectively. I wanted it to be easy to navigate and visually appealing so people could see my work and skills.</p> <p>Well, that and my first website was a static HTML page built from a template, and I wanted something that I made myself.</p> <h3>Technologies Used</h3> <p>For the front-end, I used HTML and CSS to structure and style the site.</p> <p>To add some dynamic elements, I used Three.js for 3D graphics and GSAP for smooth animations.</p> <h3>Learning Parcel and Yarn</h3> <p>I had never used Parcel or Yarn before, so I had to learn how to use them to bundle and manage my code. And let me tell you, it was a pain in the ass.</p> <p>Countless Yarn and Parcel errors later, I have a somewhat satisfactory website that I can use to show off my work.</p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>Overall, building this site was a fantastic learning experience. I'm proud of the final product and excited to continue improving it over time. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!</p> </ul> <div class="footer">&copy; 2024 Sam Witte</div> </div> <div id="info"></div> </body></html>
