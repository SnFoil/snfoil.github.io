I also improved my PCB layout skills and EDA software familiarity. </p> <img src="../fc1_soldered.5ae6e85a.jpg" alt="The soldered flight computer v1" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;width:75%;"> <ul> <li>Initial Circuit Design</li> <li>PCB Layout and Design</li> <li>Choosing Parts and Ordering the PCBs</li> <li>Final Thoughts</li> </ul> <h3>Initial Circuit Design</h3> <p> When first designing this circuit, I started with a list of goals for the project. I knew I wanted one or more sensors to collect data during an HPR (high-powered rocketry) model rocket launch, so I began researching parts. </p> <p> I found all of the sensors used in this project in the form of breakout boards from Adafruit, which are pre-assembled PCBs with the sensors and supporting circuitry on them, with easy-to-access pins. </p> <img src="../fc1_breadboard.1341fbc2.jpg" alt="Circuit designed on breadboard" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;width:75%;"> <h3>PCB Layout and Design</h3> <p> For the PCB design and layout, I used KiCAD. I chose this program because I was already familiar with it, unlike other programs like Autodesk Eagle. </p> <p> The schematic was simple: various pins from each breakout board were connected, along with some LED circuitry. I decided to use small 0603 components out of curiosity to see how difficult they would be to solder by hand (spoiler: it's pretty tough). </p> <img src="../fc1_schematic.0c6c2c40.jpg" alt="Flight computer PCB schematic" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;width:75%;"> <h3>Choosing Parts and Ordering the PCBs</h3> <p> All the components were purchased from Digikey. If you're interested in the exact parts used, there's a list in the <a href="https://github.com/samcwitte/flight-pcb-1/blob/main/parts.md">GitHub repository for this project</a>. </p> <p> The PCBs were ordered through JLCPCB, which had a very quick turnaround, and the PCBs arrived just as I designed them. </p> <h3>Final Thoughts</h3> <p> I learned a lot from this project. I brushed up on my Python skills, used three I²C devices on a single bus, and created a final product that I'm proud of. </p> <p> One of the first issues I noticed after assembly was that the micro-USB port on the Pi Pico, used to extract flight data, was inaccessible due to clearance issues. </p> <p> While I consider this project a success, there's definitely room for improvement, and version 2 is already in development. </p> <h3>Update: The Motor Failed</h3> <p> I finally launched a rocket with the flight computer inside, but unfortunately, the motor failed about halfway through its burn! </p> <p> In one of the pictures, you can see the flight computer inside the rocket, with the ~10-inch nosecone almost entirely buried in the ground. </p> <img src="../fc1_crash0.6c266f6b.jpg" alt="My rocket in the ground" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;width:75%;"> <img src="../fc1_crash1.42dc0d29.jpg" alt="The crushed computer" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;width:75%;"> <img src="../fc1_crash2.84083487.jpg" alt="Another view of the crushed computer" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;width:75%;"> <img src="../fc1_crash3.b57dcf02.jpg" alt="Yet another view of the crushed computer" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;width:75%;"> <p> While this crash was unfortunate and a bit disappointing, it provides the perfect opportunity to build a second version with improvements. <br>Version 2 was designed but never manufactured, and version 3 is currently in development, planned to be taken over and completed by the UIowa Aerospace and Rocketry Club by May 2025. </p> </ul> <div class="footer">&copy; 2024 Sam Witte</div> </div> <div id="info"></div> </body></html>
