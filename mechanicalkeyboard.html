									<h2 class="major">Summary / Table of Contents</h2>
									<p>This project was a very new beast for me. Making the PCB alone involved schematic design, component layout, and routing traces, all of which I had never touched before this project.</p>

									<h2 class="major" id="pcb">The PCB</h2>
									<p>For the PCB, I followed a basic guide explaining how to make a small 2x2 macro-pad that you can <a href="https://www.masterzen.fr/2020/05/03/designing-a-keyboard-part-1/">find here</a>, and expanded on that to create a custom keyboard.</p>
									
									<h4 class="major" id="schematic">Schematic</h4>
									<p>I'm going to be honest here. There wasn't a lot of original work in this part. Most of the schematic was copied from this guide and modified slightly to fit my criteria.</p>
									<p>That being said, I did learn how to make a schematic and import footprints into a schematic. I also got to learn a small amount about making efficient component connections in this stage.</p>

									<h4 class="major" id="pcblayout">PCB Layout</h4>
									<p>In this area, I could stretch my wings more, so to speak. In this part, I got to lay out all of the components in a way that would be later expressed on the physical board.</p>
									<p>To get the correct key spacing on the PCB, I referred to the plate that I made using a combination of <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/">keyboard-layout-editor.com</a>, which gave me the physical spacing between keys according to my custom layout, and <a href="http://builder.swillkb.com/">this Plate & Case Builder</a>. I did not use the case generator functionality of this site.</p>

									<h2 class="major" id="plate">The Plate</h2>
									<p>After I <a href="http://builder.swillkb.com/">generated the plate drawing</a>, I imported the drawing into Fusion 360, where I gave it depth using the extrusion tool. That part took maybe 30 seconds.</p>
									<p>Next, I took the dimensions of the case, covered below, and countersunk holes into the plate, as I wanted the screw heads to be flush with the top of the plate. I knew how large to make the countersinks because of an STL file I found on <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/">McMaster-Carr</a>.</p>

									<h2 class="major" id="case">The Case</h2>
									<p>Next I designed the case, which surrounds the keyboard. It's the part on the outside that sits directly on the table. I wanted this part to be aesthetically pleasing. Almost a piece of art. Let's not get too ahead of ourselves, though, I'm not super artsy ;)</p>
									<p>I gave the case a 7 degree tilt, so it was easier and more pleasant to type on. I also wanted it to be made of anodized aluminum. First because of how it looked, and second because I felt that it needed some heft to it.</p>

									<h2 class="major" id="final">Final Thoughts</h2>
									<p>Throughout this project, I deepened my knowledge and understanding of Fusion 360, PCB schematic design, and PCB layout. I also learned how make an assembly of separate parts in Fusion 360, which I think could be very useful in the future when dealing with larger-scale projects.</p>
									<p>Though I couldn't develop a physical version of it due to me being a broke college student, I would love to revisit this project in the future to improve it, and possibly make it a reality for me and perhaps a few interested others.</p>
