									<h2 class="major">Summary / Table of Contents</h2>
									<p>Throughout this project, I learned more about interfaces such as I<sup>2</sup>C and SPI. I also improved my PCB layout skills and EDA software familiarity.</p>

									<h2 class="major" id="circuitdesign">Initial Circuit Design</h2>
									<p>When first designing this circuit, I first came up with a list of things I wanted to accomplish with it. I knew I wanted one or more sensors to collect data during an HPR (high powered rocketry) model rocket launch, and so I got started finding parts.</p>
									<p>I found all of the sensors that are used in this project in the form of breakout boards from <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a>, which are basically pre-assembled PCBs with the sensors and supporting circuitry on them with easy-to-access pins.</p>
									<p> </p>

									<h2 class="major" id="pcblayout">PCB Layout and Design</h2>
									<p>For the PCB design and layout, I used KiCAD. I've used this program before, so that's why I picked it over other programs like Autodesk Eagle.</p>
									<p>The schematic is simple. Various pins from each breakout board were connected with eachother, along with some LED circuitry. I decided to go with some small 0603 components just because I was curious how difficult it would be to solder them by hand (hint: it's pretty tough).</p>

									<h2 class="major" id="orderingparts">Choosing Parts and Ordering the PCBs</h2>
									<p>All of the individual components I purchased were done so through <a href="https://www.digikey.com/">Digikey</a>. If you're interested in the exact parts used, there's a list <a href="https://github.com/samcwitte/flight-pcb-1/blob/main/parts.md">in the Github repo for this project (click me!)</a>.</p>
                                    <p>I ordered my PCBs through <a href="https://www.jlcpcb.com/">JLCPCB</a>. They had a very quick turn around and my PCBs came back just as I designed them.</p>

									<h2 class="major" id="final">Final Thoughts</h2>
									<p>I learned a lot doing this project. I brushed up on my Python skills, used 3 I<sup>2</sup>C devices on a single bus, and actually put together a final product that I'm proud of.</p>
									<p>Although I would consider this project a success, there is definitely room for improvement and things that I want to change. A version 2 is already in development.</p>
