									<h2 class="major">Summary / Table of Contents</h3>
									<p>This project is a little smaller-scale than my other ones, but I believe I still learned some valuable things from it.</p>
									<p>Throughout the development and production of my rocket mounts, I learned more about CAD modeling, 3D printing, and iterative design.</p>

									<h2 class="major" id="fusion">CAD Design</h2>
									<p>For this project, I used Fusion 360. It has a free student license, which is fantastic for me, and I was slightly more familiar with it than other CAD programs such as SOLIDWORKS or AutoCAD.</p>
									<p>My only direction on this project was that I wanted something to hold a model rocket engine. I didn't know what it would look like or what size it would be, so I just started.</p>
									<p>First, I did some research on the engine I would be using. For this design, I decided I would be using an Estes F15-4 engine. If you don't know what that means, just know that the "F" corresponds to a size. All of the motor's dimensions were listed on <a href="https://estesrockets.com/">Estes' website</a>.</p>
									<p>From there, I extended the mount to the sides and up, adding M3 sized screw holes in order to later secure it to a cardboard tube(the rocket's body).</p>

									<h2 class="major" id="3dprinting">3D Printing & Iterative Design</h2>
									<p>I initially printed the rocket mount when I thought it was done. However, once I printed the first version, I quickly came to the realization that this thing was not the best it could be. So I went back in to Fusion 360 and began tweaking it. I changed the screw holes to a slightly larger M4, increased the thickness of the vertical engine holders, and gave it another go.</p>
									<p>In this stage, I also made another model that would hold a slightly smaller E12-4 engine. The only difference was the positioning of the vertical prongs in the middle.</p>
									<p>Through a few more prints and changes in the CAD model, I got to a product that I felt was adequate for the task it needed to perform.</p>

									<h2 class="major" id="final">Final Thoughts</h2>
									<p>Throughtout this project, as touched on in the summary, I learned more about modeling with Fusion 360 and improving designs over time by prototyping them frequently.</p>
									<p>Although I have not gotten to test it, I plan to do so within the next year or so, as my interest in model rocketry is growing, and I'd like to test out something I made.</p>
